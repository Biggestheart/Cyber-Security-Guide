##  Start With Introduction









###  Conventional & Cyber crime

<h3 className="text-left font-extrabold md:text-2xl mt-8">

a) Brief comparison between a conventional crime and a cyber crime. b) List the motives and reasons behind cyber crimes.


</h3>
<div class ="pt-4"></div>
<h3 className="text-left font-bold mt-3">Answer</h3>
<div class ="pt-4"></div>



<Feature>
    <div className="font-bold opacity-80">
a) Crime is a social and economic phenomenon and is as old as the human society. Crime
    is a legal concept and has the sanction of the law. Crime or an offence is "a legal wrong
    that can be followed by criminal proceedings which may result into punishment."
    Cyber-crime is the latest and perhaps the most complicated problem in the cyber world.
    "Cyber crime may be said to be those crime, where either the computer is an object or
    subject of the conduct constituting crime. "Any criminal activity that uses a computer
    either as an instrumentality, target or a means for perpetuating further crimes comes
    within the ambit of cyber crime."There is apparently no distinction between cyber and conventional crime. However on a
    deep introspection we may say that there exists a fine linc of demarcation between the
    conventional and cyber crime. The demarcation lies in the involvement of the medium in
    cases of cyber crime. The prerequisite for cyber crime is that there should be an
    involvement of the virtual cyber medium at any stage.



    b) The crimes and criminals in the cyber world vary little from their physical world
    counterparts. Historically, and today, the same laws are used to prosecute both (ie:
    trespass, fraud, theft, copyright violation).
    The motives and profiles of criminals in the virtual world are as varied as in the physical
    world. Motives include financial benefit, thrill seeking, revenge, knowledge, and beliefs.
    Where the two worlds begin to diverge is in the lingo being built for the criminal using
    the computer in his crimes. A script kiddie is someone with a low technical skill level and
    ofa young age. A hacktivist seeks to further his views by promoting them or striking out
    at those who hold opposing views. A web defacer targets websites that can be penetrated
    and changed. Crackers circumvent copy protection mechanisms. Pirates make or
    distribute unauthorized copies of protected programs or works. Lamers have a low
    technical skill level and largely reuse the work of others. Phreakers target telephone
    systems.
    The term hacker is primarily used to describe those who participate in the insightful or
    intuitive exploration of systems. These activities are, in of themselves, benign but the
    term has also become linked with the cyber criminal. The term cracker is generally
    reserved for hackers with criminal intentions.
    Hackers often align themselves in groups. They exchange details of their exploits on web
    sites and through Internet Relay Chat (IRC) messages. They contribute technical
    knowledge to their group and even participate in collaborative attacks.

### Strong,Weak,Random Password

<h3 className="text-left font-extrabold md:text-2xl mt-8">

 Define strong, weak and random password with examples.


</h3>
<div class ="pt-4"></div>
<h3 className="text-left font-bold mt-3">Answer</h3>
<div class ="pt-4"></div>

<Feature>
    <div className="font-bold opacity-80">

        A password that is difficult to detect by both humans and computer programs, effectively
        protecting data from unauthorized access. A strong password consists of at least six
        characters (and the more characters, the stronger the password) that are a combination of
        letters, numbers and symbols (@, #, $, %, etc.) if allowed. Passwords are typically case-
        sensitive, so a strong password contains letters in both uppercase and lowercase.
        Weak passwords refer to any passwords that can be easily guessed, either because it's so
        personal to a person or because it hardly takes any time to find it via the brute-force
        method, where a hacker (here, a hacker being anyone who's intent on finding your
        password, be they a criminal in Belarus or your nosey kids) runs through all possible
        password options.
        A random password generator is software program or hardware device that takes input
        from a random or pseudo-random number generator and automatically generates a
        password. Random passwords can be generated manually, using simple sources of
        randomness such as dice or coins, or they can be generated using a computer.

### Computer Virus and Worm

<h3 className="text-left font-extrabold md:text-2xl mt-8">


Write down the difference between computer virus and worm


</h3>
<div class ="pt-4"></div>
<h3 className="text-left font-bold mt-3">Answer</h3>
<div class ="pt-4"></div>

<Feature>
    <div className="font-bold opacity-80">

        A computer virus attaches itself to a program or file enabling it to spread from one
        computer to another, leaving infections as it travels. Like a human virus, a computer virus
        can range in severity: some may cause only mildly annoying effects while others can
        damage your hardware, software or files. Almost all viruses are attached to an executable
        file, which means the virus may exist on your computer but it actually cannot infect your
        computer unless you run or open the malicious program.
        A worm is similar to a virus by design and is considered to be a sub-class of a virus.
        Worms spread from computer to computer, but unlike a virus, it has the capability to
        travel without any human action. A worm takes advantage of file or information tranSport
        features on your system, which is what allows it to travel unaided.

### Software Piracy

<h3 className="text-left font-extrabold md:text-2xl mt-8">

 What is software piracy? Discuss about the preventive measures against software piracy.



</h3>
<div class ="pt-4"></div>
<h3 className="text-left font-bold mt-3">Answer</h3>
<div class ="pt-4"></div>

<Feature>
    <div className="font-bold opacity-80">
        **1st Part:**
        Software piracy is the stealing of legally protected software. Under copyright law,
        software piracy occurs when copyright protected software is copied, distributed, modified
        or sold. Software piracy is considered direct copyright infringement when it denies
        copyright holders due compensation for use of their creative works.

        **2nd Part:**
        Here are some of the tips to prevent or lessen software piracy:
        Code Key - For the past 5 to 7 years, software developers have devised a plan to lessen
        or prevent software piracy. This is by using a code key. A code key comes with the
        software that we buy. Before fully installing the software on our computer, we must
        provide the specific code key that came with the software. After providing the code key,
        we can run the software on our computer. The code key also locks after it has been used.
        This is so that the software cannot be installed on other computers after it has been
        installed on one. We will have to call the manufacturer of the software to be able to use
        the code key again. This is not good news to people who pirate software.


        **Open Source** - Open source software is described as a free software that anyone can
        download from the Internet. A lot of different software can are licensed as open source.
        Open source software are under the license free software license. There are also different
        upgrades for these open source software that can also be freely downloaded from the
        Internet. By using open source software, people don't need to worry about spending a lot
        of money for original copies of software. This will also lessen the number of people who
        are using pirated software as there are alternative programs that can be used and they do
        not have to pay fines when they are caught.


        **Hardware Key** - A hardware key is a device that is used for anti-piracy. This tool
        prevents software vendors to distribute their products or use them without authorization
        from the copyright owner of the software. The hardware key works when it is attached to
        a computer. It monitors software licensing and enforces licensing of the protected
        software those are detected on the computer. This tool will lessen software vendors from
        illegally distributing the software that they have and is a good prevention measure for
        piracy.


        **Anti-Piracy Software** - There are different types of anti-piracy software that are
        available for free. Anti-piracy software is used to prevent illegal duplication or illegal use
        of copyrighted software. There is also an anti-piracy software that prevents hackers from
        getting into the software and copying it without consent from the copyright owner. Some
        of them are also already integrated on the disks of the software that contains the program.
        This may also be for piracy music. The anti-piracy association is also looking for other
        ways to prevent software piracy. Reporting anti-piracy may prevent it from happening.

### Hackers, Crackers & Phreakers.


<h3 className="text-left font-extrabold md:text-2xl mt-8">

Explain the difference between Hackers, Crackers and Phreakers.



</h3>
<div class ="pt-4"></div>
<h3 className="text-left font-bold mt-3">Answer</h3>
<div class ="pt-4"></div>

<Feature>
    <div className="font-bold opacity-80">

        A hacker is a person intensely interested in the arcane and recondite workings of any
        computer operating system. Hackers are most often programmers. As such, hackers
        obtain advanced knowledge of operating systems and programming languages. They
        might discover holes within systems and the reasons for such holes. Hackers constantly
        seek further knowledge, freely share what they have discovered, and never intentionally
        damage data.

        A cracker is one who breaks into or otherwise violates the system integrity of remote
        machines with malicious intent. Having gained unauthorized access, crackers destroy
        vital data, deny legitimate users service, or cause problems for their targets. Crackers can
        easily be identified because their actions are malicious.


        Phreaks (or phreakers) are usually motivated more by technical curiosity and the hacker
        ethos than any criminal intent (although phreaking is most certainly illegal). To bounce a
        call through a dozen different switching systems around the world, to our friend next
        door - all for free - is regarded by phreaks as an accomplishment. The fact that they are
        committing fraud and felonies in the process is regarded as incidental - or perhaps part of
        the fun.

- He is the one who is curious about workings of any computer software.
- Very often they are no other than unit of smart programmers.
- They have advanced knowledge of operating system and programming language.
- They require data concerned with variety of security holes, so they can exploit and damage or steal knowledge.


<u className="font-bold">Crackers</u>

- They are the ones who break into different systems with malicious intent.
- They carry out activities like making unauthorized access, destroying necessary information, stopping services provided by server, etc.
- Crackers can easily be identified because their actions are malicious.

- Phreaker word is a combination of, “Phone” + “Freak”.
- Earlier, Phreakers whistled or used an instrument to mimic tones of phone system operators to route calls and identify payments to avoid paying for an expensive call. Thus, they basically attack phone systems to obtain free phone access or using the phone line to transmit viruses and access, steal and destroy data
- Now, they break into company’s system and manipulate data.

<Feature>
    <div className="font-bold opacity-80">


        Cyber Criminals use many tools and methods to locate vulnerability of their victim.
        Following are three major phases involved in planning of cyber crime:

        **1. Reconnaissance:** "Reconnaissance" means an act of reconnoitring. In this phase
        attacker try to explore and gain every possible information about target. They use active
        and passive attacks to get this information.

        **2. Scanning and Scrutinizing:** In this phase attacker collects validity of information as
        well as finds out existing vulnerabilities. It is the key phase before actual attack happens.

        - Port scanning: Identify all ports and services (open / closed)
        - Network scanning: Verify IP address and network information before cyber
        attacks.
        - Vulnerability scanning: Checking loop hole in system.


        **3. Launching an attack:** Using the information gathered in the previous step, they attack
        the target system to gain confidential information about individuals or organizations. The
        attack is launched using the following steps:


        - Crack the password.
        - Exploit the privilege
        - Execute malicious command
        - Hide the files
        - Cover the track.

        **1St part:**
        **LDAP:** The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is one of the core protocols that was
        developed for directory services. LDAP is used to distribute lists of information
        organized into directory information trees, which are stored within a LDAP database.
        However, in order to access information stored within an LDAP database, the user must
        first authenticate their identity. It can deliver LDAP authentication as a cloud based
        service.

        It is a software protocol for enabling anyone to locate organizations, individuals and other
        resources such as files and devices in a network, whether on the public internet. It is a
        lightweight version of Directory Access Protocol which is part of X.500, a standard for
        directory services in a network.

        **RAS security for mobile devices:**

        RAS provides security features to be ensure that corporate data remains secure even
        available over the wide area network. In mobile devices;

        1. It can robust the system.
        2. Protecting corporation data and guarding the network against threats.
        3. Highly definable permissions.

**Ras**

- RAS(Remote Access Server) is a type of server that provides services to remotely connected users over a network or the Internet
- This software is designed to provide authentication, connectivity and resource access services to connecting users.
- Once connected with a RAS, a user can access his or her data, desktop, application, print and/or other supported services.

        contents, forward spams, flood the network, and impersonate accounts. They always have
        malicious intent. White hat persons are ethical hackers who is responsible for finding the
        loopholes of a system. Industries employ white hats to find security cracks in the system
        or they are also employed if any attack has taken place. Study reports revealed that most
        of the industrial attacks are from inside. Someone who knows the security system very
        well and uses this skill to pose a threat to the organization can be called as grey hat. They
        behave ethical sometimes and crackers at other times.

        a) **1st Part:**
        Identity theft is a form of stealing someone's personal information and pretending to be
        that person in order to obtain financial resources or other benefits in that person's name
        without their consent. Identity theft is considered a cyber crime.

        **2nd Part:**
        When any crime is committed over the Internet it is referred to as a cyber crime. There
        are many types of cyber crimes and the most common ones are explained below:
        Hacking: This is a type of crime wherein a person's computer is broken into so that his
        personal or sensitive information can be accessed. In the United States, hacking is
        classified as a felony and punishable as such. This is different from ethical hacking,
        which many organizations use to check their Internet security protection. In hacking, the
        criminal uses a variety of software to enter a person's computer and the person may not
        be aware that his computer is being accessed from a remote location.
        Theft: This crime occurs when a person violates copyrights and downloads music,
        movies, games and software. There are even peer sharing websites which encourage
        software piracy and many of these websites are now being targeted by the FBI. Today,
        the justice system is addressing this cyber crime and there are laws that prevent people
        from illegal downloading.

        software piracy and many of these websites are now being targeted by the FBI. Today,
        the justice system is addressing this cyber crime and there are laws that prevent people
        from illegal downloading.

        - Cyber Stalking: This is a kind online harassment wherein the victim is subjected to a
        barrage of online messages and emails. Typically, these stalkers know their victims and
        instead of resorting to offline stalking, they use the Internet to stalk. However, if they
        notice that cyber stalking is not having the desired effect, they begin offline stalking
        along with cyber stalking to make the victims' lives more miserable.

        - Identity Theft: This has become a major problem with people using the Internet for cash
        transactions and banking services. In this cyber crime, a criminal accesses data about a
        person's bank account, credit cards, Social Security, debit card and other sensitive
        information to siphon money or to buy things online in the victim's name. It can result in
        major financial losses for the victim and even spoil the victim's credit history.

        - Malicious Software: These are Internet-based software or programs that are used to
        disrupt a network. The software is used to gain access to a system to steal sensitive
        information or data or causing damage to software present in the system.

        - Child soliciting and Abuse: This is also a type of cyber crime wherein criminals solicit
        minors via chat rooms for the purpose of child pornography. The FBI has been spending
        a lot of time monitoring chat rooms frequented by children with the hopes of reducing
        and preventing child abuse and soliciting.


        b)
        - Email spamming refers to sending email to thousands and thousands of users —
        similar to a chain letter. Spamming is often done deliberately to use network resources.
        Email spamming may be combined with email spoofing, so that it is very difficult to
        determine the actual originating email address of the sender. Some email systems,
        including our Microsoft Exchange, have the ability to block incoming mail from a
        specific address. However, because these individuals change their email addresses
        frequently, it is difficult to prevent some spam from reaching your email inbox.

        - Email spoofing refers to email that appears to have originated from one source when it
        was actually sent from another source. Individuals, who are sending "junk" email or
        "spam", typically want the email to appear to be from an email address that may not
        exist. This way the email cannot be traced back to the originator.

        c) Reconnaissance is considered the first pre-attack phase and is a systematic attempt to
        locate, gather, identify, and record information about the target. The hacker seeks to find
        out as much information as possible abQut the victim. This first step is considered
        a passive information gathering. As an example, many have probably seen a detective
        movie in which the policeman waits outside a suspect's house all night and then follows
        him from a distance when he leaves in the car. That's reconnaissance; it is passive in
        nature, and, if done correctly, the victim never even knows it is occurring.

        d) Salami attack: A salami attack is a collection of small attacks that result in a larger
        attack when combined. For example, if an attacker has a collection of stolen credit card
        numbers, the attacker could 'withdraw small amounts of money from each credit card
        (possibly unnoticed by the credit card holders). Although each withdrawal is small, the
        combination of the multiple withdrawals results in a significant sum for the attacker.

### Intrusion, Forgery & Attacks

<h3 className="text-left font-extrabold md:text-2xl mt-8">

    Short note on the following:'

    a) Computer Network Intrusion

    b) Forgery

    c) Passive attack vs. Active attack

<div class ="pt-4"></div>
<h3 className="text-left font-bold mt-3">Answer</h3>
<div class ="pt-4"></div>

<Feature>
    <div className="font-bold opacity-80">
        a) Computer Network Intrusion:
        A network intrusion is any unauthorized activity on a computer network. Detecting an
        intrusion depends on the defenders having a clear understanding of how attacks work,
        In most cases, such unwanted activity absorbs network resources intended for other uses,
        and nearly always threatens the security of the network and/or its data. properly
        designing and deploying a network intrusion detection system will help block the
        intruders.
        As a first step of defence, here's a brief rundown of popular attack vectors.

        - Asymmetric Routing
        In this method, the attacker attempts to utilize more than one route to the targeted
        network device. The idea is to have thc overall attack evade detection by having a
        significant portion of the offending packets bypass certain network segments and their
        network intrusion sensors. Networks that are not set up for asymmetric routing are
        impervious to this attack methodology.

        - Buffer Overflow Attacks
        This approach attempts to overwrite specific sections of computer memory within a
        network, replacing normal data in those memory locations with a set of commands that
        will later be executed as part of the attack. In most cases, the goal is to initiate a denial of
        service (DOS) situation, or to set up a channel through which the attacker can gain remote
        access to the network. Accomplishing such attacks is more difficult when network
        designers keep buffer sizes relatively small, and/or install boundary-checking logic that
        identifies executable code or lengthy URL strings before it can be written to the buffer.

        - Gateway Interface Scripts
        The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is routinely used in networks to support
        interaction between servers and clients on the Web. But it also provides easy openings—
        such as "backtracking"—through which attackers can access supposedly secure network
        system files. When systems fail to include input verification or check for backtrack
        or the pipe
        characters, a covert CGI script can easily add the directory label " "
        character to any file path name and thereby access files that should not be available via
        the Web.

        - Protocol-Specific Attacks
        When performing network activities, devices obey specific rules and procedures. These
        protocols—such as ARP, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, and various application protocols—may
        inadvertently leave openings for network intrusions via protocol impersonation
        ("spoofing") or malformed protocol messages. For example, Address Resolution Protocol
        (ARP) does not perform authentication on messages, allowing attackers to execute "man-
        in-the-middle" attacks. Protocol-specific attacks can easily compromise or even crash
        targeted devices on a network.

        - Traffic Flooding
        An ingenious method of network intrusion simply targets network intrusion detection
        systems by creating traffic loads too heavy for the system to adequately screen. In the
        resulting congested and chaotic network environment, attackers can sometimes execute
        an undetected attack and even trigger an undetected "fail-open" condition.

        - Trojans
        These programs present themselves as benign and do not replicate like a virus or a worm.
        Instead, they instigate DoS attacks, erase stored data, or open channels to permit system
        control by outside attackers. Trojans can be introduced into a network from unsuspected
        online archives and file repositories, most particularly including peer-to-peer file
        exchanges.

        - Worms
        A common form of standalone computer virus, worms are any computer code intended to
        replicate itself without altering authorized program files. Worms often spread through
        email attachments or the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol. Undetected worms
        eventually consume so many network resources, such as processor cycles or bandwidth
        that authorized activity is simply squeezed out. Some worms actively seek out
        confidential information—such as files containing the word "finance" or
        communicate such data to attackers lying in wait outside the network.


        b) Forgery:
        Offences of computer forgery and counterfeiting have become rampant as it is very easy
        to counterfeit a document like birth certificate and use the same to perpetuate any crime.
        The authenticity of electronic documents hence needs to be safeguarded by making
        forgery with the help of computers abs explicit offence punishable by law.
        When a perpetrator alters documents stored in computerized form, the crime committed
        may be forgery. In this instance, computer systems are the target of criminal activity.
        Computers, however, can also be used as instruments with which to commit forgery. A
        new generation of fraudulent alteration or counterfeiting emerged when computerized
        color laser copiers became available. These copiers are capable of high-resolution
        copying, modification of documents, and even the creation of false documents without
        benefit of an original, and they produce documents whose quality is indistinguishable
        from that of authentic documents except by an expert.
        These schemes take very little computer knowledge to perpetrate. Counterfeit checks,
        invoices and stationery can be produced using scanners, color printers, and graphics
        software. Such forgeries are difficult to detect for the untrained eye. It is relatively easy
        to scan a logo into a completer system and go from there.


        c) Passive attack vs. Active attack:
        Active attacks alter the system or network operations while passive attack gathers
        information about the system without altering the system. Active attack can involve
        infecting the system with virus or worms or can span upto deleting the entire hard drive.
        Normally passive attacks remain undetected. Active attack can flood the entire network
        with unnecessary packets and can render it slow while passive attack can sniff network
        packets without changing them. Passive attackers can know the presence of certain user
        accounts along with their password while active attackers use this information to render
        the system useless to the owner.

        a) 1st Part:
        A cybercriminal is an individual who commits cybercrimes, where he/she makes use of
        the computer either as a tool or as a target or as both.

        Cybercriminals use computers in three broad ways:

        - Select computer as their target: These criminals attack other people's
        computers to perform malicious activities, such as spreading viruses, data theft,
        identity theft etc.
        - Uses computer as their weapon: They use the computer to carry out
        "conventional crime", such as spam, fraud, illegal gambling, etc.

        - Uses computer as their accessory: They use the save stolen or
        illegal data.

        **2nd Part:**
        When any crime is committed over the Internet it is referred to as a cyber crime. There
        are many types of cyber crimes and the most common ones are explained below:
        Hacking: This is a type of crime wherein a person's computer is broken into so that his
        personal or sensitive information can be accessed. In the United States, hacking is
        classified as a felony and punishable as such. This is different from ethical hacking,
        which many organizations use to check their Internet security protection. In hacking, the
        criminal uses a variety of software to enter a person's computer and the person may not
        be aware that his computer is being accessed from a remote location.
        Theft: This crime occurs when a person violates copyrights and downloads music,
        movies, games and software. There are even peer sharing websites which encourage
        software piracy and many of these websites are now being targeted by the FBI. Today,
        the justice system is addressing this cyber crime and there are laws that prevent people
        from illegal downloading.

        - Cyber Stalking: This is a kind online harassment wherein the victim is subjected to a
        barrage of online messages and emails. Typically, these stalkers know their victims and
        instead of resorting to offline stalking, they use the Internet to stalk. However, if they
        notice that cyber stalking is not having the desired effect, they begin offline stalking
        along with cyber stalking to make the victims' lives more miserable.

        - Identity Theft: This has become a major problem with people using the Internet for cash
        transactions and banking services. In this cyber crime, a criminal accesses data about a
        person's bank account, credit cards, Social Security, debit card and other sensitive
        information to siphon money or to buy things online in the victim's name. It can result in
        major financial losses for the victim and even spoil the victim's credit history.

        - Malicious Software: These are Internet-based software or programs that are used to
        disrupt a network. The software is used to gain access to a system to steal sensitive
        information or data or causing damage to software present in the system.

        - Child soliciting and Abuse: This is also a type of cyber crime wherein criminals solicit
        minors via chat rooms for the purpose of child pornography. The FBI has been spending
        a lot of time monitoring chat rooms frequented by children with the hopes of reducing
        and preventing child abuse and soliciting.


        b) Cloud computing and cyber security are the two advanced sectors in IT world making
        huge changes of working pattern in the field. When these two merge it opens a wide
        range of possibilities. The cloud computing security provides companies with the
        availability, reliability, and security they need to conduct business in a global
        marketplace. Advanced cyber security features combine with physical infrastructure to
        create a comprehensive, secure solution to your cloud computing needs.
        As companies migrate more and more of their data and infrastructure to the cloud, the
        question of cloud computing security becomes paramount. Cloud security provides
        multiple levels of control in a network infrastructure to afford continuity and protection.
        It's an essential ingredient in creating an environment that works for companies around
        the world. The benefits of cloud computing can be affordably attained by partnering with
        advanced private cloud computing providers in a way that doesn't jeopardize your
        company's security.
        At a time when cyber attacks are growing worldwide, and high-profile cybercrime such
        as data theft, ransomware and computer hacks have become the order of the day, experts
        believe that cloud computing may provide the security against cyber threats that
        companies need. They reason that Cloud helps security operations respond quicker to
        threats and focus on business risk as opposed to spending countless hours researching
        threats and trouble-shooting aging on-premises systems. It also saves a substantial cost
        for organizations in the long run.

    <div className="font-bold opacity-80">

        As social networking becomes more a part of our daily lives, individuals find this
        technology an attractive vehicle to perpetrate cyber crimes. Anonymity provided via
        social networks allows a person to easily portray another user's identity. Cyber criminals
        exploit such vulnerabilities to steal user credentials, which in turn can be used to breach a
        company's network infrastructure.
        The term cyber crime is confirmed as the official crime term as criminals started getting
        more aggressive over the online and becoming a threat for millions of Internet users.
        Identity theft is the key threat to many social media users, as millions of online users use
        their personal information in order to getting registered with one or more social media
        platforms. Such huge information with personal data of so many people is one of the
        easiest targets for many cyber criminals. Many users also use their credit or debit card to
        purchase different products, items or services through these social networking sites. This
        is why the cyber criminals around the world continuously try to get inside the personal
        details of many users from those social media platforms.
        We can minimize the threat of cyber attack or cyber crime by getting a little aware and
        conscious while using social networking sites.
